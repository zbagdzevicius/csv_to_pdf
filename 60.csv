The oldest existing therapeutic systems used by humanity for health and well-
being are called Traditional Medicine or Complementary and Alternative
Medicine (TM/CAM).
Increasingly, TM/CAM is being formally used within existing health-care
systems. When practised correctly, TM/CAM can help protect and improve
citizens  health and well-being. The appropriate use of TM/CAM therapies and
products, however, requires consideration of issues of safety, efficacy and
quality. This is the basis of consumer protection and is no different, in principle,
from what underpins modern medical practice. Upholding basic requirements
for the modern practice of TM/CAM therapies can support national health
authorities in the establishment of adequate laws, rules, and licensing practices.
These considerations have guided the work of the Regional Government of
Lombardy in TM/CAM which was first included in the Regional Health Plan
2002-2004. Clinical and observational studies in the region of Lombardy have
provided a crucial step in the evaluation of TM/CAM. With the help of data
from these studies, a series of governmental provisions have been used to create
a framework for the protection of consumers and providers. The cornerstone of
this process was the first Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for the
Quadrennial Cooperation Plan which was signed between the Regional
Government of Lombardy and the World Health Organization. The MOU
highlighted the need for certain criteria to be met including: the rational use of
TM/CAM by consumers; good practice; quality; safety; and the promotion of
clinical and observational studies of TM/CAM. When they were published in
2004, the WHO guidelines for developing consumer information on proper use of
traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine were incorporated into this first
MOU.
In the region of Lombardy, citizens currently play an active role in their health-
care choices. The awareness of the advantages as well as of the risks of every type
of care is therefore critical, also when a citizen actively chooses to use TM/CAM.
Consumers have begun to raise new questions related to the safe and effective
treatment by all providers of TM/CAM. For this reason, the Regional
Government of Lombardy closely follows WHO guidelines on qualified practice
of TM/CAM in order to guarantee appropriate use through the creation of laws
and regulations on skills, quality control, and safety and efficacy of products, and
clear guidelines about practitioner qualifications. The Regional Government of
Lombardy has also provided support and cooperated with WHO in developing
this series of benchmark documents for selected popularly used TM/CAM
therapies including Ayurveda, naturopathy, Nuad Thai, osteopathy, traditional
Chinese medicine, Tuina, and Unani medicine.
Modern scientific practice requires a product or a therapeutic technique to be safe
and effective, meaning that it has specific indications and evidence for care
supported by appropriate research. Practitioners, policy-makers and planners,
                                                                                   vii

"The aim of protecting both the Social-Health Plan of benchmark documents is possible to this,","Benchmarks for training in traditional Chinese medicine
        both within and outside ministries of health, are responsible for adhering to this,
        in order to guarantee the safety and the efficacy of medicines and practices for
        their citizens. Furthermore, safety not only relates to products or practices per se,
        but also to how they are used by practitioners. Therefore it is important that
        policy-makers are increasingly able to standardize the training of practitioners
        for it is another fundamental aspect of protecting both the providers and the
        consumers.
        Since 2002, the Social-Health Plan of the Lombardy Region has supported the
        principle of freedom of choice among different health-care options based on
        evidence and scientific data. By referring to the benchmarks in this present series
        of documents, it is possible to build a strong foundation of health-care options
        which will support citizens in exercising their right to make informed choices
        about different styles of care and selected practices and products.
        The aim of this series of benchmark documents is to ensure that TM/CAM
        practices meet minimum levels of adequate knowledge, skills and awareness of
        indications and contraindications. These documents may also be used to facilitate
        establishing the regulation and registration of providers of TM/CAM.
        Step by step we are establishing the building blocks that will ensure consumer
        safety in the use of TM/CAM. The Regional Government of Lombardy hopes
        that the current series will be a useful reference for health authorities worldwide,
        and that these documents will support countries to establish appropriate legal
        and regulatory frameworks for the practice of TM/CAM.

There has been a dramatic surge in popularity of the various disciplines
collectively known as traditional medicine (TM) over the past thirty years. For
example, 75% of the population in Mali and 70% in Myanmar depend on TM and
TM practitioners for primary care,1 while use has also greatly increased in many
developed countries where it is considered a part of complementary and
alternative medicine (CAM). For instance, 70% of the population in Canada2 and
                   3
80% in Germany have used, in their lifetime, traditional medicine under the title
complementary and alternative medicine.
Integration of traditional medicine into national health systems
Traditional medicine has strong historical and cultural roots. Particularly in
developing countries, traditional healers or practitioners would often be well-
known and respected in the local community. However, more recently, the
increasing use of traditional medicines combined with increased international
mobility means that the practice of traditional medicines therapies and
treatments is, in many cases, no longer limited to the countries of origin. This can
make it difficult to identify qualified practitioners of traditional medicine in some
countries.
One of the four main objectives of the WHO traditional medicine strategy 2002-
2005 was to support countries to integrate traditional medicine into their own
health systems. In 2003, a WHO resolution (WHA56.31) on traditional medicine
urged Member States, where appropriate, to formulate and implement national
policies and regulations on traditional and complementary and alternative
medicine to support their proper use. Further, Member States were urged to
integrate TM/CAM into their national health-care systems, depending on their
relevant national situations.
Later in 2003, the results of a global survey on policies for TM/CAM conducted
by WHO showed that the implementation of the strategy is making headway.
For example, the number of Member States reporting that they have a national
policy on traditional medicine rose from five in 1990, to 39 in 2003, and to 48 in
2007. Member States with regulations on herbal medicines rose from 14 in 1986,
to 80 in 2003, and to 110 in 2007. Member States with national research institutes
of traditional medicine or herbal medicines rose from 12 in 1970, to 56 in 2003,
and to 62 in 2007.4

"backgrounds. They provide a second stage, distributed to assist practitioners of traditional care as other health","Benchmarks for training in traditional Chinese medicine
        Ideally, countries would blend traditional and conventional ways of providing
        care in ways that make the most of the best features of each system and allow
        each to compensate for weaknesses in the other. Therefore, the 2009 WHO
        resolution (WHA62.13) on traditional medicine further urged Member States to
        consider, where appropriate, inclusion of traditional medicine in their national
        health systems. How this takes place would depend on national capacities,
        priorities, legislation and circumstances. It would have to consider evidence of
        safety, efficacy and quality.
        Resolution WHA62.13 also urged Member States to consider, where appropriate,
        establishing systems for the qualification, accreditation or licensing of
        practitioners of traditional medicine. It urged Member States to assist
        practitioners in upgrading their knowledge and skills in collaboration with
        relevant providers of conventional care. The present series of benchmarks for
        basic training for selected types of TM/CAM care is part of the implementation
        of the WHO resolution. It concerns forms of TM/CAM that enjoy increasing
        popularity (Ayurveda, naturopathy, Nuad Thai, osteopathy, traditional Chinese
        medicine, Tuina, and Unani medicine)
        These benchmarks reflect what the community of practitioners in each of these
        disciplines considers to be reasonable practice in training professionals to
        practice the respective discipline, considering consumer protection and patient
        safety as core to professional practice. They provide a reference point to which
        actual practice can be compared and evaluated. The series of seven documents is
        intended to:
               support countries to establish systems for the qualification, accreditation
                   or licensing of practitioners of traditional medicine;
               assist practitioners in upgrading their knowledge and skills in
                   collaboration with providers of conventional care;
               allow better communication between providers of conventional and
                   traditional care as well as other health professionals, medical students
                   and relevant researchers through appropriate training programmes;
               support integration of traditional medicine into the national health
                   system.
        The documents describe models of training for trainees with different
        backgrounds. They list contraindications identified by the community of
        practitioners, so as to promote safe practice and minimize the risk of accidents.
        Drafting and Consultation Process
        The most elaborated material to establish benchmarks comes from the countries
        where the various forms of traditional medicine under consideration originated.
        These countries have established formal education or national requirements for
        licensure or qualified practice. Any relevant benchmarks must refer to these
        national standards and requirements.
        The first stage of drafting of this series of documents was delegated to the
        national authorities in the countries of origin of each of the respective forms of
        traditional, complementary or alternative medicine discussed. These drafts were
        then, in a second stage, distributed to more than 300 reviewers in more than 140
        countries. These reviewers included experts and national health authorities,

                                                              Introduction
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been in use in China for over two
thousand years. It has its own unique theories for treating disease and to enhance
health. There are many modalities included in TCM, such as Chinese herbal
medicine, moxibustion, acupuncture, or Tuina.1 TCM uses traditional Chinese
medicines; these include herbs, herbal materials, herbal preparations and
finished herbal products which have been documented in classical and modern
literature on TCM. These Chinese Materia Medica may contain non-plant
substances, such as animal and mineral materials.
Treatment with TCM involves practitioners who may be called TCM practitioner,
TCM doctor, TCM therapist or TCM physician. There are also other categories of
professionals: distributors and dispensers for whom training is relevant to the
safety and quality of the materials used in TCM medicines.
Traditional Chinese medicine is used widely and increasingly practiced outside
China (1-3). However, many countries have not yet developed specific training or
established legislation to regulate its practice. In countries where no regulatory
framework currently exists, there may be no educational, professional or legal
framework governing the practice. Moreover, with the rapid growth in demand
for TCM, other types of health-care professionals may wish to gain additional
qualifications in order to practice TCM.
This document presents what the community of TCM practitioners, experts and
regulators considers to be adequate levels and models for training TCM
practitioners, as well as for dispensers and distributors. It provides training
benchmarks for trainees with different backgrounds, as well as what the
community of TCM practitioners considers to be contraindications for safe
practice of TCM and for minimizing the risk of accidents. Together, these can
serve as a reference for national authorities wishing to establish systems of
training, examination and licensure that support the qualified practice of TCM.

1.1 The development of Traditional Chinese medicine
    Traditional Chinese medicine has been practiced in China for over 2,000 years.
    TCM was developed empirically from clinical experience, and documented in
    many classical texts (4). During the period of 221 207 BC, literature already
    included comprehensive records from doctors of internal medicine (Ji Yi) and
    doctors of external medicine and traumatology (Yang Yi). The Yellow Emperor s
    Internal Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing: 475 221 BC) systematically documented
    human structure, physiology, pathology, diagnosis, treatment and preservation.
    The Treatise on Cold Diseases and Miscellaneous Disorders (Shang Han Za Bing Lun)
    (196 204 AD) described the therapeutic principles of rendering treatment
    according to differentiation of syndromes. Thus, the theoretical basis of TCM was
    further strengthened. The first official TCM school, the Imperial Medical School
    (Tai Yi Shu), was founded in China in 624 AD. Over time, various departments of
    TCM clinical practice were developed, namely, internal medicine (Ti Liao),
    paediatrics (Shao Xiao), external medicine (Chuang Zhong), ear, eye, stomatology
    (Er Mu Kou Chi), and physiotherapy (Jiao Fa). During the Jin and Tang Dynasties
    (265   907 AD), clinical specialisations were also reflected by the publication of
    monographs in gynaecology and obstetrics, paediatrics, external medicine,
    emergency medicine and traumatology.
    There is also abundant literature relating to the general practice of TCM. This
    includes Shennong s Classic of Materia Medica (Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing) (220 AD),
    which was the first book completely devoted to the description of Chinese
    Materia Medica. The Newly Revised Materia Medica (Xin Xiu Ben Cao) was the first
    official monograph compiled and issued by the government during the Tang
    Dynasty (659 AD). The Compendium of Materia Medica (Ben Cao Gang Mu) is one of
    the classics compiled in the Ming Dynasty (1368   1644 AD). Over the past 50
    years, a number of textbooks and monographs on TCM have been compiled and
    published. Higher education on TCM is now available in a substantial number of
    TCM universities and colleges throughout China, as well as in some other
    countries, such as Australia. Education and research on TCM in these countries
    have been well documented, and to a degree, standardized (5).
    There is today a sophisticated body of knowledge built over centuries, including
    basic theory, diagnostic procedures and treatment approaches.                      TCM is
    commonly used for chronic diseases, but also for some acute conditions. It has
    been used in such areas as internal medicine, gynaecology, paediatrics,
    traumatology, external medicine, dermatology, emergency medicine, and eye,
    ear, nose and throat. According to TCM theory it is used to treat not only the
    secondary manifestations (Biao) but also the primary causes (Ben) of various
    conditions.
                                                                                                3

traditional Chinese medicine relies on Chinese medicine treatment aims to the yin and,"Benchmarks for training in traditional Chinese medicine
        Traditional Chinese medicine philosophy differs significantly from other health-
        care modalities and this strongly influences the attitude and approach of TCM in
        health care. Traditional Chinese medicine is guided by a unique theoretical
                                                                               1

        theory, the qi, blood and body fluids theory, and the differential diagnosis of
        syndromes. Traditional Chinese medicine relies on contemporary diagnostic
        methods, such as laboratory tests and diagnostic imaging, as well as on
        traditional diagnostic techniques. Traditional Chinese medicine treatment aims to
        promote and regulate the flow of qi and blood, to regulate the functions of the
                             4
        zang-fu organs and to balance yin and yang. In order to maximize therapeutic
        outcomes, patient management relies on Chinese Materia Medica and TCM
        formulae used in conjunction with dietary therapy, rehabilitative exercises,
        supportive measures, and patient education and counselling and may, when
        required, refer to other types of health professionals.
1.2     Chinese Materia Medica
        The Yellow Emperor s Internal Classic (Huang Di Nei Jing) (475   221 BC) recorded
        details on herbal processing, such as Rhizoma Pinelliae (Ban Xia) and Crinis
        Carbonisatus (Xue Yu Tan). Shennong s Classic of Materia Medica (Shen Nong Ben
        Cao Jing) (220 AD) was the first book that provided the theoretical framework for
        the practice of TCM while also documenting details of processing methods for
        toxic Chinese Materia Medica and explaining the rationale of these methods.
        Alchemy, which is considered to be the precursor of the development of modern
        medicinal chemistry, was particularly popular during Jin Dynasty (265   420
        AD). Grandfather Lei s Discussion of Processing of Materia Medica (Lei Gong Pao Zhi
        Lun) (420   479 AD) was the earliest complete treatise on processing techniques
        such as various methods of cleaning, cutting, drying, stir-baking, boiling and
        calcination. These methods still guide current practice. The Collection of
        Commentaries on the Classic of Materia Medica (Ben Cao Jing Ji Zhu) (500 AD)
        documented properties, sources, harvesting and collection practices, and
        identification of Chinese Materia Medica. In 659 AD, the Government issued
        their first official text, the Newly Revised Materia Medica (Xin Xiu Ben Cao).
        Processing techniques were further systematically compiled and introduced as
        guidelines for herbal processing during the Song Dynasty (960   1279 AD). The
        Compendium of Materia Medica (Ben Cao Gang Mu) is the most recognized relevant
        classic text and was compiled in the Ming Dynasty (1368   1644 AD) (6-8).

          The theory of yin and yang originated in antiquity in China. It is a theory dealing with
        the origins of the universe as well as the motion and variation of all things in the natural
        world.

        believed that these elements are indispensible to daily life and productive labour and that
        these five elements were key to the normal variations in the natural world.

          According to classic Chinese philosophy, qi is the primary state of the universe. Qi,
        blood and body fluids, the essential substances for life activities, flow constantly inside
        the body and all originate from the viscera.

           Zang-fu is a collective term for internal organs which are divided into two major
        categories, namely the five zang-organs - the heart, liver, spleen, lungs and kidneys; and
        the six fu-organs - the gallbladder, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, urinary
        bladder and sanjiao (the triple energizer).

Medica trade and reduce toxicity.,"                                    The origin and principles of traditional Chinese medicine
The first official TCM school, the Imperial Medical School (Tai Yi Shu), was
founded in China in 624 AD. The school consisted of eight dispensers (Zhu Yao)
and 24 assistant dispensers (Yao Tong) of TCM who were responsible for Chinese
Materia Medica processing and dispensing. From the Song to Yuan Dynasties
(960   1368 AD), the specific pharmaceutical affairs agencies were set up and an
 Exchange Act  (Shi Yi Fa) was developed to regulate the Chinese Materia
Medica trade and national patents/registrations. According to this Act, the
national pharmaceutical administration developed regulations for quality testing,
distribution, and the application of TCM (6).
Over the last 100 years, a number of TCM textbooks and monographs on
processing, preparation, identification, pharmacology and toxicology have been
compiled and published. Higher education is now available in TCM
universities/colleges throughout China. Education and research on TCM in
China has been well documented.
Traditional Chinese medicines include not only medicinal plants, but also
minerals and animal products. Their dispensing and distribution are guided by
TCM theory and many require preparing and processing prior to clinical
application. The processing and preparation procedures may influence the
therapeutic properties and reduce toxicity.
                                                                                            5

        2. Training traditional Chinese medicine
                                                                  practitioners
2.1 Categories of training programmes
    Regulating the practice of TCM and preventing practice by unqualified
    practitioners require a proper system of training, examination and licensing.
    Benchmarks for training have to take into consideration the following:
          content of the training;
          method of the training;
          to whom the training is to be provided and by whom;
          the roles and responsibilities of the future practitioner;
          the level of education required in order to undertake training.
    Experts in TCM distinguish three types of TCM training depending on prior
    training and clinical experience of trainees.
    Type I training programmes are aimed at those who have completed high-school
    education or equivalent, but have no prior medical or other health-care training
    or experience. These trainees are required to study a full TCM programme. Type
    I training programmes cover the basic theories of traditional Chinese and
    allopathic medicine, as well as the knowledge and skills required for the
    qualified and safe practice of TCM and relevant research. These programmes are
    typically three- or four-year, full-time or equivalent programmes offered by an
    appropriately equipped institution (college or university). The duration is a
    minimum of 2460 hours, consisting of at least 1560 hours of theory and
    laboratory/clinical practice and 900 hours of supervised clinical practicum. The
    programmes are designed to produce TCM practitioners who are qualified to
    practise as primary-contact health-care professionals, independently or as
    members of a health-care team, at the community level or within health-care
    centres or hospitals.
    Type II training programmes are conversion programmes aimed at those with
    medical or other health-care training who wish to become recognized TCM
    practitioners. Trainees are to study the entire theory of traditional Chinese
    medicine. These programmes may be structured to provide for either full-time or
    part-time study, but they should satisfy all requirements included in Type I
    training, and have flexible curricula to offer appropriate training for health
    professionals with different training backgrounds. Type II training programmes
    will generally require two to three years of study, full time or equivalent, and
    will cover all areas of the Type I curriculum not otherwise addressed in the
    individual's prior training. Other health-care professionals may complete the
    requirements for training as a TCM practitioner over a reduced period of time
    due to credits granted from their prior education.
                                                                                               7

upon the components of TCM prescriptions;,"Benchmarks for training in traditional Chinese medicine
        Type III training programmes are aimed at practising TCM practitioners with
        either no prior medical or other health-care training, or inadequate training.
        These programmes are designed to upgrade skills and to allow trainees to obtain
        formal qualifications for the qualified and safe practice of TCM. Type III
        programmes may include all of the components of Type I programmes, but the
        length and components of this programme may vary substantially, depending
        upon the clinical experience of the trainee. The learning outcomes should be
        comparable to those of a Type I programme. Type III programmes may be
        offered on a full-time or part-time basis.
2.2     Benchmark learning outcomes
        TCM training is expected to provide trainees with technical, communication,
        practice and information management skills and competencies (5,9).
        Technical skills
        The TCM practitioner should be able to:
               describe normal human structures and functions and their relevance to

               apply knowledge of TCM principles to the diagnosis of diseases;
               identify clinical conditions and refer to other health-care professionals
                   when required, and in a timely manner;

2.3.4 Adaptation of the curriculum to trainees with prior health
training: Type II programmes
Type II training programmes are designed to enable those with prior health-care
training, typically as a medical or other health-care professional, to add TCM to
their skills. Type II training programmes have to be tailored to previous
education and experience. The community of TCM practitioners and experts
considers that no less than 800 hours of student/teacher contact on TCM subjects
are necessary (typically 675 contact hours on theory, 185 on practical), plus not
less than 500 hours of supervised clinical practicum.
The curriculum of a Type II programme is identical to that of the Type I
programme, excluding those areas which have been acceptably covered through
the applicant s prior training as a medical or other health-care professional. This
would include specific TCM subjects as well as those Chinese and western
medical subjects necessary for TCM clinical practice, to result in the same
learning outcomes as Type I programmes.

        2.3.5 Adaptation of the curriculum to trainees with prior health
        training: Type III programmes
        Type III training programmes are designed to upgrade the knowledge and skills
        of TCM practitioners without sufficient prior training. Applicants for Type III
        programmes may be offered credits or be considered in light of their previous
        training, qualifications and experience and the curriculum has to be tailored to
        specific needs. The syllabus of the Type III programme will include all areas
        addressed in the Type I programme, excluding those areas which have been
        learned through the applicant s prior training and experience. The community of
        TCM practitioners and experts considers that no less than 800 hours of
        student/teacher contact hours on TCM subjects are necessary (typically 675
        contact hours on theory, 185 on practical), plus 520 hours of theory and 150 hours
        of practical on western medicine. Type III training programmes aim for the same
        learning outcomes as Type I programmes.

        3. Training traditional Chinese medicine
                                dispensers and distributors
    Distributors and dispensers of TCM play a key role in the delivery of TCM
    services. TCM distributors supply Chinese Materia Medica and TCM formulae to
    the dispensers. TCM dispensers provide Chinese Materia Medica or TCM
    formulae to patients. Their work requires knowledge and skills related to
    regulations, procedures and techniques. Quality control is therefore a key aspect
    and benchmarks for training have to take into consideration the following:
           content of the training;
           method of the training;
           to whom the training is to be provided and by whom;
           the roles and responsibilities of the future distributors and dispensers;
           the level of education required in order to undertake training.
3.1 A benchmark training curriculum for TCM dispensers
    TCM practitioners and experts consider that TCM dispensers require a full
    curriculum including basic theories and skills of TCM. A total of 1,000 hours is
    suggested, consisting of 800 hours of theory and practical learning and 200 hours
    of clinical training in an appropriate dispensary or pharmacy under the
    supervision of a qualified dispenser or pharmacist. This programme is for those
    who have completed high school education or equivalent but have no prior
    medical or other health-care training or experience.
    In order to allow dispensers of TCM to work either independently or as members
    of health-care teams, at the community level or within health facilities or
    pharmacies, the training programme has to enable them to:
           prepare slides and identify plant species using prepared slides or pressed
            dried specimens in a herbarium;
           perform laboratory procedures for TCM medicinal chemistry, and the
            techniques of extraction, separation and identification of chemical
            components, such as alkaloids and volatile oils (10,11).
    The programme includes elements of TCM and of Western medicine.
    3.1.1 Elements of TCM
    Pharmacology and pharmacognosy of TCM
          Basic concepts of medicinal plants;
          Basic methods of propagation and sustainable harvesting of medicinal

          Basic knowledge of pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica;
          Properties and pharmacological actions of TCM formulae;
          Key factors affecting pharmacological actions;
          Pharmacology and toxicology of TCM formulae.
                                                                                              15

    The community of practitioners and experts of TCM has identified a set of
    incompatibilities and contraindications in TCM. These can usefully be
    complemented with the WHO guidelines for safety issues related to herbal
    medicines (12-15).
4.1 Incompatibility of Chinese Materia Medica
    In classical texts, eighteen incompatible herbs (Shi Ba Fan) and nineteen
    antagonistic herbs (Shi Jiu Wei) are documented as being incompatible with TCM
    prescription. This is an important concept (16), even though current knowledge
    does support the use of some of the combinations. TCM practitioners and experts
    recommend extreme caution in the use of such combinations.

4.3 Dietary considerations
    Food may have an impact on the outcome of TCM prescriptions. Therefore, in an
    attempt to maximize therapeutic effects, TCM practitioners and experts
    recommend restriction of uncooked, cold, spicy, hot, or greasy foods during the
    administration of some TCM prescriptions. However, dietary advice can be
    modified according to the different clinical conditions and constitutions of
    individuals. For example, for heat syndromes, hot, spicy, greasy and deep fried
    food is to be avoided; while for cold syndromes, uncooked and cold food is
    restricted. For patients with obstruction of qi in the chest, fatty meat, internal
    organs of animals, and wine are to be limited; while for patients with
    hyperactivity of liver yang, dizziness, and irritability, intake of pepper, chilli,
    garlic and alcohol are discouraged. For deficiencies of the spleen and stomach,
    deep fried, greasy, and raw food are discouraged.
4.4 Prevention of complications from TCM clinical practice
    TCM practitioners and experts recommend careful assessment of a patient s
    history and the interpretation of clinical findings in order to minimize the risk of
    adverse drug reactions from the prescription of TCM. This includes gathering
    information about co-morbidities and the current use of medication, including
    long-term steroid use and anti-coagulant therapy.
4.5 Quality of medicines
    Adverse events may be caused by contamination, adulteration, misidentification,
    inappropriate use of species and/or prescribing dosages. For this reason,
    dispensers and distributors of TCM should pay particular attention to these
    issues, in line with the WHO guidelines for quality control and safety of herbal
    medicines (18,19,20).
